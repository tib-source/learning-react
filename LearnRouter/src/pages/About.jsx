        Sleep deprivation causes all sorts of challenges and problems. When one
        doesn’t get enough sleep one’s mind doesn’t work clearly. Studies have
        shown that after staying awake for 24 hours one’s ability to do simple
        math is greatly impaired. Driving tired has been shown to be as bad as
